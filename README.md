## Game Guide

### Placing Ships
The aveilable ships are 5 and they are placed to a 10 x 10 grid.


| Type | Ships  | Positions  | Points of hit | Bonus if sunk|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|1| Carrier    |5| 350| 1000|
|2| Battleship |4| 250| 500 |
|3| Cruiser    |3| 100| 250|
|4| Submarine  |3| 100|  0 |
|5| Destroyer  |2|  0 | 0  |

Create two `.txt` files one for player: `player_SCENARIO.txt`, and another one for enemy `enemy_SCENARIO.txt`

Each `.txt` file contains 5 lines. Each line is in the form:   type, x_cordinate, y_cordinate, is_vertical

Example: 

*"1,3,2,1" means that Carrier ship will be placed to (3,2) position horizontally.* <br/>
*"2,5,5,2" means that Cruiser ship will be placed to (5,5) position vertically.*

**Restrinction in placement**

1. Ships can be placed only inside a grid 
2. In one cell maximimum must be one ship
3. All ships are of different types
4. Two ships must have distance at least two cells

If the placement is not proper, an exception is throwded and user is notificated with message
